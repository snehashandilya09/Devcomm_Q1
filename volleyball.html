        Volleyball is a popular team sport played by two teams, each consisting of six players, on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective of the game is to score points by successfully grounding the ball in the opponent's court, typically over the net. Players use a combination of strategic serves, passes, sets, and spikes to control the ball and outmaneuver the opposing team. Volleyball is known for its fast-paced and dynamic nature, requiring agility, teamwork, and precise communication among players. The game is played both indoors and on the beach, with variations in rules and court dimensions.
